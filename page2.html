                    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-red-700 mb-4 pb-2 border-b border-red-200">1. Summary</h2>
                    <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">Riddle Rosehearts is the current leader of Heartslabyul Dorm at Night Raven College. Known for his strict adherence to rules and unwavering belief in maintaining order, he embodies the spirit of the Queen of Hearts' unyielding principles. Riddle is a diligent student who strives for perfection in all aspects of his life, often putting immense pressure on himself and those around him.</p>
                    <p class="leading-relaxed">His character arc revolves around learning to balance his strictness with empathy and understanding, challenging his rigid worldview influenced by his upbringing. Despite his initially harsh demeanor, Riddle possesses a deep sense of responsibility and cares for his dorm members, albeit in his own unique way.</p>

                    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-red-700 mb-4 pb-2 border-b border-red-200">2. Appearance</h2>
                    <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">Riddle has a slender build and stands at 165cm (5'5"). He has striking red hair styled in a neat bob cut, adorned with a small golden crown and black heart-shaped hair clips. His eyes are a piercing golden color. He is typically seen in the standard Night Raven College uniform, which he wears meticulously.</p>
                    <p class="leading-relaxed">His Heartslabyul dorm uniform features a red and white color scheme with prominent heart motifs, reflecting the Queen of Hearts' aesthetic. He often carries a red magic pen that complements his dorm's theme.</p>

                    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-red-700 mb-4 pb-2 border-b border-red-200">3. Personality</h2>
                    <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">Riddle is initially portrayed as an authoritarian and hot-headed individual, obsessed with rules and traditions. He believes that strict adherence to rules is the only way to achieve order and prevent chaos, stemming from his overly restrictive upbringing. He is quick to punish those who break even the most minor rules, often using his unique magic "Off With Your Head!" to collar offenders.</p>
                    <p class="leading-relaxed">Beneath his rigid exterior, Riddle is a diligent, earnest, and somewhat insecure person. He genuinely wants to be a good leader and uphold the traditions of his dorm, but his methods are often counterproductive due to his lack of emotional understanding and his deep-seated trauma. Through the story, he gradually learns the importance of flexibility, empathy, and allowing others (and himself) to express themselves freely.</p>

                    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-red-700 mb-4 pb-2 border-b border-red-200">4. Unique Magic & Abilities</h2>
                    <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">Riddle's unique magic is <strong class="text-red-600">"Off With Your Head!"</strong>, which allows him to place a magical collar on anyone, sealing their magic. This ability is a direct reference to the Queen of Hearts' command to behead those who displease her. He uses this power frequently to enforce rules and discipline within Heartslabyul dorm.</p>
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4 pl-4 leading-relaxed">
                        <li><strong>Magical Proficiency:</strong> As a dorm leader, Riddle possesses strong magical abilities, particularly in offensive spells and precise magical control.</li>
                        <li><strong>Leadership:</strong> Despite his flaws, he is a capable leader who manages his dorm effectively, ensuring all rules and traditions are followed.</li>
                        <li><strong>Academic Excellence:</strong> Riddle is a top student at Night Raven College, demonstrating high intelligence and dedication to his studies.</li>

                    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-red-700 mb-4 pb-2 border-b border-red-200">5. Background</h2>
                    <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">Riddle comes from a wealthy and highly disciplined household where his mother, a strict overbearing woman, controlled every aspect of his life. From a young age, Riddle was subjected to countless rules, strict study schedules, and a highly controlled diet. He was never allowed to make his own choices or enjoy simple pleasures, leading to a repressed and emotionally stunted childhood.</p>
                    <p class="leading-relaxed">This upbringing instilled in him a deep-seated belief that rules are absolute and deviation leads to dire consequences. His position as Dorm Leader of Heartslabyul, a dorm founded on the Queen of Hearts' stringent rules, perfectly aligned with his ingrained philosophy, further reinforcing his rigid worldview.</p>
